# NetPanzer
### Open Source RTS

## Introduction

NetPanzer is an online multiplayer tactical warfare game designed for FAST
ACTION combat. Gameplay concentrates on the core - no resource management is
needed. The game is based on quick tactical action and unit management in
real-time. Battles progress quickly and constantly as destroyed players respawn
with a set of new units. Players can join or leave multiplayer games at any
time.

## 20+ Years of Development

The original development of NetPanzer was done from PyroSoft inc. In
1999 they stopped development and released the game 2002 in GPL and it was nearly
forgotten, until Ingo announced it at happypenguin.org. Soon after this
announcement a group of coders did the linux port in roughly 2 weeks, with
another 2 weeks polishing for the first release. Since then development has picked up and slowed
down, with various different teams and maintainers. The current maintainer of the game and masterserver
is "winrid" on GitHub.

## To Play

Go to the Releases tab in GitHub and download the version for your OS. The version in Linux repos as of 2024
is very (8+yrs) old, so we suggest simply downloading the latest release directly.

### Latest Download

[You can download the latest version here.](https://github.com/netpanzer/netpanzer/releases/tag/0.9.0-RC-6)

[Weekly Linux AppImage is available here.](https://github.com/netpanzer/netpanzer/releases/tag/appimage-weekly)

Note that the current RC version is considered unstable, however we are quickly approaching the `0.9.0` release and
need your feedback and testing! All current servers (as of 2024) are running this version, so this is what you want
if you want to play on a public server.
