## Change version number

meson.build
support/scripts/prep-appimage.sh
SConstruct


Remove from meson default options:

    'b_sanitize=address,undefined',
    'b_lundef=false'

Those two options can be disabled easily enough by package maintainers, but
anybody else who wants to build from the release wouldn't necessarily know
they should be disabled. Having that enabled slows the game down a bit.


## Translations

TBD

## ChangeLog

Update/Review

commit changes (NOTE: meson dist only packages *committed* changes)

## Source Distribution Archive

meson dist --no-tests --include-subprojects

    meson adds all files tracked by version control so...

    Remove unneeded directories from the resulting xz file
    (The process will be in the GitHub workflow)

    Remove subprojects/packagecache (when --include-subprojects is used, the extracted
    source should be included. We'll check the first time around)

    Remove any directories that aren't needed for building or packaging, ie,
    keep files like netpanzer.png but remove scripts used for packaging. Keep
    scripts used to build the appimage or create docker images I think).

Example:

        xz -d ${REL_TAR}.xz
        tar --delete -f ${REL_TAR} rmw-${VERSION}/support
        xz ${REL_TAR}
        sha256sum ${REL_TAR}.xz > ${REL_TAR}.xz.sha256sum

## AppImage

run:

support/scripts/prep-appimage.sh

Or run the workflow after all release-related changes have been pushed to the
master branch. Download the artifact and attach the files from the zip to the
release page.

## Docker Image

Docker image should be created from the workflow, as it push an amd64 and
arm64 image. This can be automated when releases are pushed. For now, the
workflow has a "dispatch" trigger, so you can click "run workflow" at
https://github.com/netpanzer/netpanzer/actions/workflows/docker.yml and you'll
be prompted for the tag. The default is "latest".

## Post release

Change version number to a dev version (see files above). Note messon doesn't
allow alpha characters and typically projects use something like 0.9.0.555 for
dev versions.


Add back to meson default options:

    'b_sanitize=address,undefined',
    'b_lundef=false'
