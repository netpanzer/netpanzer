## Change version number

meson.build
support/scripts/prep-appimage.sh
SConstruct


Remove from meson default options:

    'b_sanitize=address,undefined',
    'b_lundef=false'

Those two options can be disabled easily enough by package maintainers, but
anybody else who wants to build from the release wouldn't necessarily know
they should be disabled. Having that enabled slows the game down a bit.


## Translations

TBD

## ChangeLog

Update/Review

commit changes (NOTE: meson dist only packages *committed* changes)

## Source Distribution Archive

meson dist --include-subprojects (argument only needed after subprojects are
added. We'll probably need subprojects for the Windows build. On Linux, meson
should use system physfs and lua, on Windows we may want to use meson's wrap
system)

meson adds all files tracked by version control so...

Remove unneeded directories from the resulting xz file
  (The process will be in the GitHub workflow)

Example:

        xz -d ${REL_TAR}.xz
        tar --delete -f ${REL_TAR} rmw-${VERSION}/support
        xz ${REL_TAR}
        sha256sum ${REL_TAR}.xz > ${REL_TAR}.xz.sha256sum

## AppImage

run:

support/scripts/prep-appimage.sh

## Post release

Change version number to a dev version (see files above). Note messon doesn't
allow alpha characters and typically projects use something like 0.9.0.555 for
dev versions.


Add back to meson default options:

    'b_sanitize=address,undefined',
    'b_lundef=false'
